      {
        "question": "What is a Root of Trust?",
        "answer": "A Root of Trust (RoT) is the foundation of security in a system. It's a hardware component that is inherently trusted and can't be altered. It serves as the starting point for establishing a chain of trust throughout the system, validating each component before it executes."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does Caliptra integrate into an SoC?",
        "answer": "Caliptra is designed to be integrated as an IP block within an SoC design. It provides RTL that can be incorporated into the silicon design process, along with firmware that runs on the integrated hardware to provide root of trust capabilities."
      },
      {
        "question": "What makes Caliptra different from other Root of Trust solutions?",
        "answer": "Caliptra is an open-source, vendor-neutral solution developed collaboratively by industry leaders. This approach ensures transparency, interoperability across platforms, and broad industry adoption, unlike proprietary solutions that may be limited to specific vendors or ecosystems."
      },
      {
        "question": "What security features does Caliptra provide?",
        "answer": "Caliptra provides several key security features including establishing cryptographic identity for hardware components, measured boot capabilities that record the boot process, and hardware attestation that allows the hardware to prove its authenticity and integrity to higher-level software."
      },
      {
        "question": "How can I contribute to the Caliptra project?",
        "answer": "Caliptra is an open-source project under the CHIPS Alliance. You can contribute by submitting pull requests, reporting issues, or joining discussions on the project's GitHub repositories."
